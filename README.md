## Project Background

*La Ferme* is a Mexican company dedicated to the **artisanal pasteurization of cow cream**, operating continuously since 1980. Its business model has historically relied on manual production processes to deliver high-quality pasteurized cream to various local retailers. For over four decades, **inventory management, quality control, production logs, and sales records** have been handled manually and in a non-standardized manner.

In 2020, the company made a strategic decision to initiate a comprehensive **digital transformation** and establish a **data governance framework** aimed at improving operational efficiency, ensuring product traceability, and enabling more informed decision-making. However, the organization is still in the **early stages** of this transformation, and the existing information is currently **limited, inconsistent, and often duplicated**.

As a **data analyst** supporting this transition, my role involves:
- Collaborating in the design of the data model  
- Assessing the quality of existing records  
- Defining standardization and data cleaning rules  
- Building a solid foundation for the systems that will manage, analyze, and leverage data reliably in the future

## Key Business Metrics

Once the digital system is operational, the following metrics will be monitored:

- **Production volume** (liters of pasteurized cream)  
- **Quality rejection rate**  
- **Average distribution time**  
- **Monthly sales volume** by channel  
- **Net monthly income**  
- **Cost per liter produced**

## Key Areas: Insights and Recommendations

### Category 1: Traceability and Data Governance

Current data is **scattered, incomplete, and inconsistent**.  
**Recommendations:**
- Design a **relational data model** incorporating master data domains (suppliers, batches, products, customers)
- Begin a **controlled manual digitization and normalization process**
- Define and apply **SQL-based validation and cleaning rules**
- In the medium term, develop a **centralized and accessible data catalog** for operational use

---

### Category 2: Production and Product Quality

No detailed records of **temperature or processing times** currently exist.  
**Recommendations:**
- Install **IoT sensors** to capture real-time production data
- Use collected data to detect **correlations** between conditions and product quality
- Enable the creation of a **predictive quality control system**

---

### Category 3: Sales and Distribution Channel Analysis

Sales records must be **digitized and structured**.  
**Recommendations:**
- Determine the **contribution of each sales channel** (direct-to-store, by order, bulk)
- Develop a **weekly demand forecasting model** based on seasonality and customer profile
- Optimize production and **reduce waste**

---

### Category 4: Operational Efficiency and Cost Optimization

Due to fragmented data, production and distribution **costs are difficult to estimate**.  
**Recommendations:**
- Build a system that **integrates production, sales, and delivery route data**
- Implement **weather-based forecasting** and **route optimization tools**
- Aim to **reduce delivery time and operational costs**
